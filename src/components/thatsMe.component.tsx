                                        I call drive. The drive to do sth. Why?
                                        Because in my opinion it fits best to
                                        describe a deep... drive of
                                        someone. <br/> <br/>

                                        When I was young I got in contact with
                                        electronics, automation and software.
                                        Suddenly, I wanted to know the way
                                        things work and wasn't satisfied just
                                        operating and controlling systems, but
                                        rather building, constructing, creating,
                                        designing, establishing software (and
                                        hardware).
                                        So many words just to describe what a
                                        software developer does. <br/> <br/>
                                        I was the first person in my family to
                                        achieve and complete the Abitur and I am
                                        going to be the first person in my
                                        family, who has an academic grade. <br/>
                                        This alone gives me satisfaction and
                                        the <span

                                        Something less measurable: I am advanced
                                        in handling
                                        normal consumer techs like Microsoft
                                        Office, Excel and Word for sure and
                                        operating systems like MacOS and Windows
                                        easily, as well as a little bit Linux
                                        and RaspberryOS. <br/>
                                        Furthermore, I am partly a electrical
                                        engineer as this was part of my school
                                        education of my Abitur.
